# iOS7Colors

iOS7Colors is a simple category on UIColor which provides you some of the standard colors used throughout iOS 7.

## Usage

The easiest way to integrate iOS7Colors is using CocoaPods. Just add this to your Podfile:

    pod 'iOS7Colors', '~> 2.0.0'

Usage is really simple. Just include `UIColor+iOS7Colors.h` & `UIColor+iOS7Colors.m` in your project if you're not using cocoapods and import the header file you need the colors.

    #import "UIColor+iOS7Colors.h"

    UILabel *label = [UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];

    label.textColor = [UIColor iOS7redColor];
